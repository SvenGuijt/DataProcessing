Answer to question 5:

A branch is a separate environment where new ideas (code for example) can be tried out.
When something is edited inside of a branch it does not affect the master branch. A 
branch is thus helpful to try out some new things while it won’t be merged until it’s
ready to be checked by any collaborators.
